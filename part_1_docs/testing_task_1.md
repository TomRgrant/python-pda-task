### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    # should be == not =
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
      #else needs :
    else
      return False
   
  #def not dif, missing coma in parameters, not indented
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    #no card
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  


def cards_total(self, cards):
  #total need to be = to something
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    #for loop will only run once return needs to be out the loop.
    #need to convert the int to a str to concatenate.
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
